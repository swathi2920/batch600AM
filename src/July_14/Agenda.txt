varible -- int x=88;
		x=5;
		
Array --- int[] id={3,5,6,72}

 collections:
 -- can store multiple datatypes & multiple values / object.
 -- manuplication methods
 
 List --- interface
 -- can store duplicate data , null, non-synchronized
 	classes:
 	-------
 	ArrayList --- read data only in forward direction
 			-- order of data stored is as per entry.
 			
 	LinkedList--- read data only in forward & backward direction
 
 
 Set --- interface
 --- can store only unique data,null,, non-synchronized
	 classes:
 	-------
 	HashSet--- read data only in forward direction
 	 ---- data order is maintained by hash table --argorithim
 	 
 	LinkedHashSet-- read data only in forward & backward direction
 	TreeSet -- no null, synchronized
 	   --- order of data is in ascending order.
